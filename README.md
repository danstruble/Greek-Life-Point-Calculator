A python script to track, verify, and display statistics of participation points within greek organizations.

Documentation:

There are 2 permission levels, regular user, and administrator. You can designate these users by appending their name to either the users or admins file, using commas to separate each entry.

Administrators are capable of calculating organization wide statistics, entering approved events to be used as a verification check, as well as modify these events, and add or delete event participation for other users.

Regular users are capable of adding events that they have attended themselves, and run statistics for themselves.
